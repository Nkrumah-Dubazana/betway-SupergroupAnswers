## Overview of Exercises

### Question 14: Magic Potion Laentlier
- **Objective:** Determine if a potion's power level is magical by checking if it is the exact cube of an integer.
- **Approach:** Compute the cube root, round it, and verify if cubing it returns the original power level.
- **File:** `14-Magic_Potion_Laentlier.py`

### Question 15: Sneaky Outcomes
- **Objective:** Identify the two duplicate outcomes in an array where exactly two outcomes have been mistakenly repeated.
- **Approach:** Count the frequency of each element using a dictionary and extract the ones that appear more than once.
- **File:** `15-Sneaky_Outcomes.py`

### Question 16: Reformat String to Alternating Case
- **Objective:** Reformat a string such that only alphabetical characters alternate between uppercase and lowercase, while non-alphabetical characters retain their positions.
- **Approach:** Traverse the string, adjusting the case for alphabet characters based on an index counter, and preserving other characters.
- **File:** `16-Reformat_String_to_Alternating_Case.py`

### Question 17: Organizing Books into Identical Sets
- **Objective:** Check if books on a shelf (represented by integers) can be arranged into sets where each set contains exactly _x_ copies of the same book (with _x_ > 1).
- **Approach:** Count occurrences of each book and compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these counts to determine if a valid grouping exists.
- **File:** `17-Organizing_Books_into_Identical_Sets.py`
